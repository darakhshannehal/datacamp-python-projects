##### The team responsible for the Star Wars partnership has asked for specific information in preparation for their meeting:

```{python}
# What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed? Save your answer as a variable the_force, as an integer.

# Merge lego_sets with parent_themes on parent_theme and name
merged_df = lego_sets.merge(parent_themes, how="left", left_on="parent_theme", right_on="name")

# Filter for Licensed & Star Wars theme
star_wars_sets = merged_df[
    (merged_df["is_licensed"] == True) &
    (merged_df["parent_theme"] == "Star Wars")
]

# Total number of licensed sets
licensed_total = merged_df[merged_df["is_licensed"] == True].shape[0]
# Total number of licensed Star Wars sets
star_wars_total = star_wars_sets.shape[0]

# percentage
the_force = round((star_wars_total / licensed_total) * 100)
# Print
print("Percentage of licensed LEGO sets that are Star Wars themed:", the_force, "%")
```

```{python}
# In which year was the highest number of Star Wars sets released? Save your answer as a variable new_era, as an integer.

# Group by year and count the number of sets per year
set_counts = star_wars_sets['year'].value_counts()
# Sort in descending order and take the year with the highest count
new_era = set_counts.idxmax()

# Print
print(f"{new_era} is the year with the highest number of Star Wars sets released.")
